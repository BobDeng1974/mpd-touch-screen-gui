# Usage

This the frontend GUI application for my DIY hifi system (based on Raspberry Pi 2B and HifiBerry AMP+) showing on an IL9341 LCD including a touch screen (with 320x240 resolution).

## How to adapt

You will have to change the cover path constants. Most of the other parts are system agnostic.


# State

At the moment the code is really ugly and I'm experimenting a lot. Basic song controls work flawlessly, so it's usable in a limited scope.
